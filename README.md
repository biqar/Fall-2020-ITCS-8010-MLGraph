# Fall-2020-ITCS-8010-TopicsInCS
This repository contains the projects and assignments of course **"ITCS 8010: Machine Learning with Graphs and Large Networks"**. This course has been taken in Fall 2020 semester, as part of my PhD degree at UNC Charlotte.

## Week 1
* Discussed about the course structure
  * No single topic in the course is too hard by itself. But we will cover and touch upon many topics and this is what makes the course hard.
* Discussed about different commonly seen networks around us; and some of the applications
  * Polarization on Twitter
  * Information Diffusion
  * Information Cascades
  * Product Adoption
  * Misinformation
* Network Analysis Tools
  * NetworkX (we will mainly use this), JUNG, iGraph

## Week 2
* Discussed about the structure of the Web Graph
  * [Bow-tie Structure of the Web](https://kharshit.github.io/blog/2017/09/08/structure-of-the-web#myfootnote1)
  * Original Paper: [Broder et al.](https://kharshit.github.io/assets/graph_broder.pdf)
  * A revisit to the old thought: [Graph Structure in the Web — Revisited](http://www.quantware.ups-tlse.fr/FETNADINE/papers/P4.9.pdf)
```
We confirm the existence of a giant strongly connected component; we however find, as observed by other 
researchers [12, 5, 3], very different proportions of nodes that can reach or that can be reached from 
the giant component, suggesting that the “bow-tie structure” as described in [10] is strongly dependent 
on the crawling process, and to the best of our current knowledge is not a structural property of the web.

... the distributions of indegree, outdegree and sizes of strongly connected components are not power laws, 
contrarily to what was previously reported for much smaller crawls, although they might be heavy-tailed.
```
* Discussed about the basics of key network properties
  * Degree distribution
  * Path length
  * Clustering coefficient
