## Week 4
* Discussion on the last week's asynchronous materials.
* MSN Network: Key network properties
  * Degree distribution: Heavily skewed; Avg. degree = 14.4
  * Path length: 6.6
  * Clustering coefficient: 0.11
  * Observation: Constant degree; constant avg. Clustering coeff; Linear avg. path length
* Open Question: Is there any graph that have path length greater than N?
* Erdos-Renyi Random Graph: Key network properties
  * Degree distribution: Binomial distribution
  * Path length: O(n * logn)
  * Clustering coefficient: C = p = (mean of binomial distribution)/n
  * Observation: Very much different comparing with the real network (i.e. MSN Network)
